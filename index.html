       Struts have two purposes. Struts, like shock absorbers, act as shock absorbers. On the inside, a strut is the equivalent of a shock absorber. A piston is situated at the end of the piston rod and acts against hydraulic fluid to control spring and suspension movement. The strut's second function is to give structural support for the vehicle's suspension.Struts influence ride comfort and handling, as well as vehicle control, stopping, turning, tire rotation, and tire wear. <br>

    In engineering, aeronautics, architecture, and anatomy, a strut is a structural component. Struts resist linear pressure in most cases, although they may also be used in tension. Stuts can be used to make geometricial shapes, organized and postioned. They can be shaped as chandilers, wall decleration.

 A kagome is a type of weaving that is similar to braiding. A covenantal weave   is described as the interlacing of multiple separate sets of threads (or ‘‘weavers") at varying angles to each other, where conventional weave is defined as the interlacing of 2 different sets of yarns (weft) at right angles to each other.Kagome is a well-defined approach for creating complicated curved geometries with a single mesh structure, eliminating the need for assembly or node assembly. Trivially woven structures are an appealing target for investigation across a diverse range of design and craft practices, including architecture, due to their self-bracing capacity, greater shear resistance (compared to biaxial weave), ability to rigorously control geometry, high redundancy, ability to locally repair, and potent aesthetic qualities.

          <p> Kagome is a well-defined approach for creating complicated curved geometries with a single mesh structure, eliminating the need for assembly or node assembly. Trivially woven structures are an appealing target for investigation across a diverse range of design and craft practices, including architecture, due to their self-bracing capacity, greater shear resistance (compared to biaxial weave), ability to rigorously control geometry, high redundancy, ability to locally repair, and potent aesthetic qualities.We highlight important material limited to computational representation of weave patterns and related computational approaches in this area, with a special focus on architectural design.We discuss methods for building and improving mesh topologies, weave approaches in general, and kagome representation approaches in particular, and conclude with a summary that outlines the outstanding problem that we address.Schiftner et al. offer a technique for improving triangular design meshes so that the incircles of mesh faces form a packing – a CP mesh – with an emphasis on mesh representations relevant to architecture.
          </p>

       

          <p>

  The kagome pattern, which is created by connecting the centers of tangent incircles, is closely connected to this mesh type. Due to the rarity of accurate CP meshes, an optimisation technique is employed to improve a mesh to a close approximation of the design objective. The mesh is produced by repeatedly relaxing an isotropic centroidal Voronoi diagram using Loyd's method. However, this results in the placement of singularities at random, which is undesirable if regular geometries are desired. As explained by Narain et al., a popular approach for locally improving the topology of mesh is to use mesh operators, edge collapse, edge flipping, and edge splitting. It enables for the approximate placement of the needed valence in the desired spot.

The kagome pattern is a viable example of how the research works. Using the struts do something similar.
